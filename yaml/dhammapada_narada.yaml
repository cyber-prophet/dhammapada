    verse: |
      Here he is happy, hereafter he is happy. In both states the well-doer is happy. "Good have I done" (thinking thus), he is happy. Furthermore, he is happy, having gone to a blissful state.
  - number: 19
    verse: |
      Though much he recites the Sacred Texts, but acts not accordingly, that heedless man is like a cowherd who counts others kine. He has no share in the fruits of the Holy Life.

      The fool will desire undue reputation, precedence among monks, authority in the monasteries, honour among other families.
  - number: 74
