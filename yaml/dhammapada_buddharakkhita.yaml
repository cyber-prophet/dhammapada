  verses:
  - number: 1
    verse: |
      Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.

      Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts happiness follows him like his never-departing shadow.

      Just as a storm throws down a weak tree, so does Mara overpower the man who lives for the pursuit of pleasures, who is uncontrolled in his senses, immoderate in eating, indolent, and dissipated.
  - number: 8
    verse: |
      Just as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain, so Mara can never overpower the man who lives meditating on the impurities, who is controlled in his senses, moderate in eating, and filled with faith and earnest effort.
  - number: 9
    verse: |
      Whoever being depraved, devoid of self-control and truthfulness, should don the monks yellow robe, he surely is not worthy of the robe.
  - number: 10
    verse: |
      But whoever is purged of depravity, well-established in virtues and filled with self-control and truthfulness, he indeed is worthy of the yellow robe.

  - number: 15
    verse: |
      The evil-doer grieves here and hereafter; he grieves in both the worlds. He laments and is afflicted, recollecting his own impure deeds.
  - number: 16
    verse: |
      The doer of good rejoices here and hereafter; he rejoices in both the worlds. He rejoices and exults, recollecting his own pure deeds.
  - number: 17
    verse: |
      The evil-doer suffers here and hereafter; he suffers in both the worlds. The thought, "Evil have I done," torments him, and he suffers even more when gone to realms of woe.
  - number: 18
    verse: |
      The doer of good delights here and hereafter; he delights in both the worlds. The thought, "Good have I done," delights him, and he delights even more when gone to realms of bliss.
  - number: 19
    verse: |
      Much though he recites the sacred texts, but acts not accordingly, that heedless man is like a cowherd who only counts the cows of others -- he does not partake of the blessings of the holy life.
  - number: 20
    verse: |
      Little though he recites the sacred texts, but puts the Teaching into practice, forsaking lust, hatred, and delusion, with true wisdom and emancipated mind, clinging to nothing of this or any other world -- he indeed partakes of the blessings of a holy life.
- number: 2

  verses:

      Heedful among the heedless, wide-awake among the sleepy, the wise man advances like a swift horse leaving behind a weak jade.
  - number: 30

      Realizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot, and fortifying this mind like a well-fortified city, fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom. Then, guarding the conquest, remain unattached.

      Ere long, alas! this body will lie upon the earth, unheeded and lifeless, like a useless log.

  - number: 50
    verse: |
      Let none find fault with others; let none see the omissions and commissions of others. But let one see ones own acts, done and undone.

      Like a beautiful flower full of color but without fragrance, even so, fruitless are the fair words of one who does not practice them.

      As from a great heap of flowers many garlands can be made, even so should many good deeds be done by one born a mortal.
  - number: 54
    verse: |
      Not the sweet smell of flowers, not even the fragrance of sandal, tagara, or jasmine blows against the wind. But the fragrance of the virtuous blows against the wind. Truly the virtuous man pervades all directions with the fragrance of his virtue.

  - number: 61
    verse: |
      Should a seeker not find a companion who is better or equal, let him resolutely pursue a solitary course; there is no fellowship with the fool.
  - number: 62
    verse: |
      The fool worries, thinking, "I have sons, I have wealth." Indeed, when he himself is not his own, whence are sons, whence is wealth?
  - number: 63
    verse: |
      A fool who knows his foolishness is wise at least to that extent, but a fool who thinks himself wise is a fool indeed.
  - number: 64
    verse: |
      Though all his life a fool associates with a wise man, he no more comprehends the Truth than a spoon tastes the flavor of the soup.
  - number: 65

      So long as an evil deed has not ripened, the fool thinks it as sweet as honey. But when the evil deed ripens, the fool comes to grief.
  - number: 70
    verse: |
      Month after month a fool may eat his food with the tip of a blade of grass, but he still is not worth a sixteenth part of the those who have comprehended the Truth.
  - number: 71
    verse: |
      Truly, an evil deed committed does not immediately bear fruit, like milk that does not turn sour all at once. But smoldering, it follows the fool like fire covered by ashes.
  - number: 72
    verse: |
      To his own ruin the fool gains knowledge, for it cleaves his head and destroys his innate goodness.
  - number: 73
    verse: |
      The fool seeks undeserved reputation, precedence among monks, authority over monasteries, and honor among householders.
  - number: 74
    verse: |
      "Let both laymen and monks think that it was done by me. In every work, great and small, let them follow me" -- such is the ambition of the fool; thus his desire and pride increase.
  - number: 75
    verse: |
      One is the quest for worldly gain, and quite another is the path to Nibbana. Clearly understanding this, let not the monk, the disciple of the Buddha, be carried away by worldly acclaim, but develop detachment instead.

  title: The Wise Man
  verses:
  - number: 76
    verse: |
      Should one find a man who points out faults and who reproves, let him follow such a wise and sagacious person as one would a guide to hidden treasure. It is always better, and never worse, to cultivate such an association.
  - number: 77

      Let him admonish, instruct and shield one from wrong; he, indeed, is dear to the good and detestable to the evil.

      Do not associate with evil companions; do not seek the fellowship of the vile. Associate with the good friends; seek the fellowship of noble men.

      On hearing the Teachings, the wise become perfectly purified, like a lake deep, clear and still.
  - number: 83
    verse: |

  - number: 84
    verse: |

      Few among men are those who cross to the farther shore. The rest, the bulk of men, only run up and down the hither bank.

  - number: 87
    verse: |

    verse: |
      The mindful ones exert themselves. They are not attached to any home; like swans that abandon the lake, they leave home after home behind.

  - number: 107
    verse: |
      Though for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds, that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.

    verse: |
      He who inflicts violence on those who are unarmed, and offends those who are inoffensive, will soon come upon one of these ten states:

    verse: |
      Sharp pain, or disaster, bodily injury, serious illness, or derangement of mind,
  - number: 139
    verse: |
      trouble from the government, or grave charges, loss of relatives, or loss of wealth,
  - number: 140

      or houses destroyed by ravaging fire; upon dissolution of the body that ignorant man is born in hell.
  - number: 141
    verse: |
      Neither going about naked, nor matted locks, nor filth, nor fasting, nor lying on the ground, nor smearing oneself with ashes and dust, nor sitting on the heels (in penance) can purify a mortal who has not overcome doubt.
  - number: 142
    verse: |
      Even though he be well-attired, yet if he is poised, calm, controlled and established in the holy life, having set aside violence towards all beings -- he, truly, is a holy man, a renunciate, a monk.

    verse: |
      There is one who, turning away from desire (for household life) takes to the life of the forest (i.e., of a monk). But after being freed from the household, he runs back to it. Behold that man! Though freed, he runs back to that very bondage!
  - number: 345
    verse: |
      That is not a strong fetter, the wise say, which is made of iron, wood or hemp. But the infatuation and longing for jewels and ornaments, children and wives --
  - number: 346
    verse: |
      that, they say, is a far stronger fetter, which pulls one downward and, though seemingly loose, is hard to remove. This, too, the wise cut off. Giving up sensual pleasure, and without any longing, they renounce the world.
  - number: 347
    verse: |
      Those who are lust-infatuated fall back into the swirling current (of samsara) like a spider on its self-spun web. This, too, the wise cut off. Without any longing, they abandon all suffering and renounce the world.
