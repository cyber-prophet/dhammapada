  verses:
  - number: 1
    verse: |
      Phenomena are   preceded by the heart,
      ruled by the heart,
      made of the heart.
      If you speak or act
      with a corrupted heart,
      then suffering follows you --
      as the wheel of the cart,
      the track of the ox
      that pulls it.

    verse: |
      Phenomena are  preceded by the heart,
      ruled by the heart,
      made of the heart.
      If you speak or act
      with a calm, bright heart,
      then happiness follows you,
      like a shadow
      that never leaves.

      He insulted me,

      He insulted me,

  - number: 5
    verse: |
      Hostilities arent stilled
      through hostility,

      this, an unending truth.
  - number: 6
    verse: |
      Unlike those who dont realize
      that were here on the verge

  - number: 7
    verse: |
      One who stays focused on the beautiful,
      is unrestrained with the senses,

      apathetic, unenergetic:
      Mara overcomes him
      as the wind, a weak tree.
  - number: 8
    verse: |
      One who stays focused on the foul,
      is restrained with regard to the senses,
      knowing moderation in food,
      full of conviction & energy:
      Mara does not overcome him
      as the wind, a mountain of rock.
  - number: 9
    verse: |
      He who, depraved,
      devoid
      of truthfulness
      & self-control,
      puts on the ochre robe,
      doesnt deserve the ochre robe.
  - number: 10
    verse: |
      But he who is free
      of depravity
      endowed
      with truthfulness
      & self-control,
      well-established
      in the precepts,
      truly deserves the ochre robe.
  - number: 11
    verse: |
      Those who regard
      non-essence as essence
      and see essence as non-,
      dont get to the essence,
      ranging about in wrong resolves.
  - number: 12
    verse: |
      But those who know
      essence as essence,
      and non-essence as non-,
      get to the essence,
      ranging about in right resolves.
  - number: 13

      As rain seeps into
      an ill-thatched hut,
      so passion,
      the undeveloped mind.
  - number: 14
    verse: |
      As rain doesnt seep into
      a well-thatched hut,
      so passion does not,
      the well-developed mind.
  - number: 15
    verse: |
      Here he grieves
      he grieves hereafter.

      He grieves, hes afflicted,
      seeing the corruption
      of his deeds.
  - number: 16
    verse: |
      Here he rejoices
      he rejoices hereafter.

    verse: |
      Here hes tormented
      hes tormented  hereafter.
      In both worlds
      the wrong-doers tormented.

      Ive done wrong.
      Having gone to a bad destination,
      hes tormented
      all the more.

    verse: |
      Though he recites much the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but is negligent and does not practise according to the Dhamma, like a cowherd who counts the cattle of others, he has no share in the benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).
  - number: 20

      Though he recites only a little of the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but practises according to the Dhamma, eradicating passion, ill will and ignorance, clearly comprehending the Dhamma, with his mind freed from moral defilements and no longer clinging to this world or to the next, he shares the benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).

      When the wise person drives out
      heedlessness
      with heedfulness,
      having climbed the high tower
      of discernment,
      sorrow-free,

      as the enlightened man,
      having scaled
      a summit,
      the fools on the ground below.
  - number: 29
    verse: |
      Heedful among the heedless,
      wakeful among those asleep,
      just as a fast horse advances,

      so the wise.
  - number: 30
    verse: |
      Through heedfulness, Indra won

      always.
  - number: 31
    verse: |

  - number: 33
    verse: |
      Quivering, wavering,
      hard to guard,
      to hold in check:
      the mind.

      the shaft of an arrow.
  - number: 34
    verse: |
      Like a fish

  - number: 35
    verse: |
      Hard to hold down,
      nimble,

      brings ease.
  - number: 36
    verse: |
      So hard to see,
      so very, very subtle,
      alighting wherever it likes:

      brings ease.

    verse: |
      Wandering far,
      going alone,
      bodiless,

      Those who restrain it:
      from Maras bonds
      theyll be freed.
  - number: 38
    verse: |
      For a person of unsteady mind,

      no fear.
  - number: 40
    verse: |
      Knowing this body
      is like a clay jar,
      securing this mind
      like a fort,
      attack Mara
      with the spear of discernment,
      then guard whats won
      without settling there,
      without laying claim.
  - number: 41
    verse: |
      All too soon, this body
      will lie on the ground
      cast off,
      bereft of consciousness,

  - number: 42
    verse: |
      Whatever an enemy might do

    verse: |
      Who will penetrate this earth
      & this realm of death
      with all its gods?

      the flower?

      Knowing this body
      is like foam,
      realizing its nature

      cutting out
      the blossoms of Mara,
      you go where the King of Death
      cant see.
  - number: 47
    verse: |
      The man immersed in
      gathering blossoms,
      his heart distracted:

      a village asleep.
  - number: 48
    verse: |
      The man immersed in
      gathering blossoms,
      his heart distracted,
      insatiable in sensual pleasures:
      the End-Maker holds him
      under his sway.
  - number: 49
    verse: |
      As a bee -- without harming
      the blossom,
      its color,
      its fragrance --
      takes its nectar & flies away:
      so should the sage
      go through a village.
  - number: 50
    verse: |
      Focus,
      not on the rudenesses of others,
      not on what theyve done
      or left undone,
      but on what you
      have & havent done
      yourself.
  - number: 51
    verse: |
      Just like a blossom,

      when not carried out.
  - number: 52
    verse: |
      Just like a blossom,
      bright colored
      & full of scent:
      a well-spoken word
      is fruitful
      when well carried out.
  - number: 53
    verse: |
      Just as from a heap of flowers
      many garland strands can be made,
      even so
      one born & mortal
      should do
      -- with whats born & is mortal --
      many a skillful thing.
  - number: 54
    verse: |
      No flowers scent
      goes against the wind --
      not sandalwood,
      jasmine,
      tagara.

      The person of integrity
      wafts a scent
      in every direction.
  - number: 55

      Sandalwood, tagara,
      lotus, & jasmine:

  - number: 60
    verse: |
      Long for the wakeful is the night.

      If, in your course, you dont meet

      firmly,
      alone.
      Theres no fellowship with fools.
  - number: 62
    verse: |
      I have sons, I have wealth --
      the fool torments himself.
      When even he himself
      doesnt belong to himself,
      how then sons?
      How wealth?
  - number: 63
    verse: |
      A fool with a sense of his foolishness
      is -- at least to that extent -- wise.
      But a fool who thinks himself wise
      really deserves to be called
      a fool.
  - number: 64
    verse: |
      Even if for a lifetime
      the fool stays with the wise,
      he knows nothing of the Dhamma --

      the taste of the soup.
  - number: 65
    verse: |
      Even if for a moment,
      the perceptive person stays with the wise,
      he immediately knows the Dhamma --
      as the tongue,
      the taste of the soup.
  - number: 66
    verse: |
      Fools, their wisdom weak,
      are their own enemies
      as they go through life,
      doing evil
      that bears
      bitter fruit.
  - number: 67
    verse: |
      Its not good,
      the doing of the deed
      that, once its done,
      you regret,
      whose result you reap crying,
      your face in tears.
  - number: 68
    verse: |
      Its good,
      the doing of the deed
      that, once its done,
      you dont regret,
      whose result you reap gratified,
      happy at heart.
  - number: 69
    verse: |
      As long as evil has yet to ripen,
      the fool mistakes it for honey.
      But when that evil ripens,

      pain.
  - number: 70
    verse: |
      Month after month
      the fool might eat
      only a tip-of-grass measure of food,
      but he wouldnt be worth
      one sixteenth
      of those whove fathomed
      the Dhamma.
  - number: 71
    verse: |
      An evil deed, when done,
      doesnt -- like ready milk --
      come out right away.
      It follows the fool,
      smoldering
      like a fire
      hidden in ashes.
  - number: 72
    verse: |
      Only for his ruin
      does renown come to the fool.
      It ravages his bright fortune
      & rips his head     apart.
  - number: 73
    verse: |
      He would want unwarranted status,
      preeminence     among monks,
      authority       among monasteries,
      homage      from lay families.
  - number: 74
    verse: |
      Let householders & those gone forth
      both think that this
      was done by me alone.
      May I alone determine
      whats a duty, whats not:
      the resolve of a fool
      as they grow --
      his desire & pride.
  - number: 75
    verse: |
      The path to material gain
      goes one way,
      the way to Unbinding,
      another.
      Realizing this, the monk,
      a disciple to the Awakened One,
      should not relish offerings,
      should cultivate        seclusion
      instead.

      Regard him as one who
      points out
      treasure,
      the wise one who
      seeing your faults
      rebukes you.

      not worse.
  - number: 77
    verse: |

      Drinking the Dhamma,
      refreshed by the Dhamma,
      one sleeps at ease

      by the noble ones,
      the wise person
      always delights.
  - number: 80
    verse: |
      Irrigators guide    the water.
      Fletchers shape     the arrow shaft.
      Carpenters shape    the wood.
      The wise control
      themselves.
  - number: 81
    verse: |
      As a single slab of rock
      wont budge in the wind,
      so the wise are not moved
      by praise,
      by blame.
  - number: 82
    verse: |

    verse: |
      Everywhere, truly,
      those of integrity
      stand  apart.
      They, the good,
      dont chatter in hopes
      of favor or gains.
      When touched
      now by pleasure,
      now pain,
      the wise give no sign
      of high
      or low.
  - number: 84
    verse: |
      One who wouldnt --
      not for his own sake
      nor that of another --
      hanker for
      wealth,
      a son,
      a kingdom,
      his own fulfillment,
      by unrighteous means:
      he is righteous, rich
      in virtue,
      discernment.
  - number: 85
    verse: |
      Few are the people
      who reach the Far Shore.
      These others
      simply scurry along
      this shore.
  - number: 86
    verse: |
      But those who practice Dhamma
      in line with the well-taught Dhamma,
      will cross over the realm of Death
      so hard to transcend.
  - number: 87
    verse: |
      Forsaking dark practices,
      the wise person
      should develop the bright,
      having gone from home
