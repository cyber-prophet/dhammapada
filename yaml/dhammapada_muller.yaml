  title: The Twin-Verses
  verses:
  - number: 1
    verse: |
      All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage.
  - number: 2
    verse: |
      All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.
  - number: 3
    verse: |
      "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.
  - number: 4
    verse: |
      "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.
  - number: 5
    verse: |

      The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;--but those who know it, their quarrels cease at once.
  - number: 7
    verse: |
      He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses uncontrolled, immoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mara (the tempter) will certainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.
  - number: 8
    verse: |
      He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mara will certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain.
  - number: 9
    verse: |
      He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed himself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth, is unworthy of the yellow dress.
  - number: 10
    verse: |
      But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in all virtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is indeed worthy of the yellow dress.
  - number: 11
    verse: |
      They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth in truth, never arrive at truth, but follow vain desires.
  - number: 12
    verse: |
      They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at truth, and follow true desires.
  - number: 13
    verse: |
      As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will break through an unreflecting mind.
  - number: 14
    verse: |
      As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will not break through a well-reflecting mind.
  - number: 15
    verse: |
      The evil-doer mourns in this world, and he mourns in the next; he mourns in both. He mourns and suffers when he sees the evil of his own work.
  - number: 16
    verse: |
      The virtuous man delights in this world, and he delights in the next; he delights in both. He delights and rejoices, when he sees the purity of his own work.
  - number: 17
    verse: |
      The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in the next; he suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done; he suffers more when going on the evil path.
  - number: 18
    verse: |
      The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is happy in the next; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of the good he has done; he is still more happy when going on the good path.
  - number: 19
    verse: |
      The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large portion (of the law), but is not a doer of it, has no share in the priesthood, but is like a cowherd counting the cows of others.
  - number: 20
    verse: |
      The follower of the law, even if he can recite only a small portion (of the law), but, having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness, possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind, he, caring for nothing in this world or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood.
- number: 2
  title: On Earnestness
  verses:
  - number: 21

      Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The wise man keeps earnestness as his best jewel.

      Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and lust! He who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.
  - number: 28
    verse: |
      When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he, the wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the fools, serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one that stands on a mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.
  - number: 29
    verse: |
      Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the wise man advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.
  - number: 30
    verse: |
      By earnestness did Maghavan (Indra) rise to the lordship of the gods. People praise earnestness; thoughtlessness is always blamed.

      A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks with fear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning all his fetters, small or large.

    verse: |
      A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks with fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect state)--he is close upon Nirvana.

  title: Thought

    verse: |
      As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on dry ground, our thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mara (the tempter).

      It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.
  - number: 36
    verse: |
      Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well guarded bring happiness.

      Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves about alone, is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the heart), will be free from the bonds of Mara (the tempter).

    verse: |
      If a mans thoughts are unsteady, if he does not know the true law, if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be perfect.

    verse: |
      If a mans thoughts are not dissipated, if his mind is not perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil, then there is no fear for him while he is watchful.
  - number: 40
    verse: |
      Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mara (the tempter) with the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should never rest.

      Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth, despised, without understanding, like a useless log.
  - number: 42

      The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world of Yama, and the world of the gods. The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower.
  - number: 46
    verse: |
      He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it is as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of Mara, and never see the king of death.

      Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these sorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.

  - number: 61
    verse: |
      If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no companionship with a fool.
  - number: 62
    verse: |
      "These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me," with such thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to himself; how much less sons and wealth?
  - number: 63
    verse: |
      The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.

      If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.

  - number: 70
    verse: |
      Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the tip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle of those who have well weighed the law.
  - number: 71
    verse: |
      An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly); smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.

    verse: |
      And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.
  - number: 73

      Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!
  - number: 74
    verse: |
      "May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be done or is not to be done," thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire and pride increase.
  - number: 75
    verse: |

  - number: 77
    verse: |
      Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is improper!--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.
  - number: 78
    verse: |
      Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best of men.

  - number: 84
    verse: |
      If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good, wise, and virtuous.

  - number: 87
    verse: |
      A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where there seemed to be no enjoyment.

    verse: |
      Leaving all pleasures behind, and calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the troubles of the mind.     </p>

    verse: |
      If a man for a hundred years worship Agni (fire) in the forest, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred years.
