    verse: |
      Creatures from mind their character derive,
      Mind-marshalled are they, and mind-made:
      If with a mind corrupt one speak or act, Him doth pain follow,
      As the wheel the beast of burdens foot.

    verse: |
      Creatures from mind their character derive,
      Mind-marshalled are they, and mind-made:

      Him doth happiness follow,
      Even as a shadow that declineth not.

    verse: |
      The man who dwelleth contemplating pleasure,
      With faculties incontinent,

      Slothful, weak of will,
      Him surely Maro overthrows,
      As wind a weakling tree.
  - number: 8
    verse: |
      The man who dwelleth unregarding pleasure,

  - number: 11
    verse: |
      Those who imagine the essential in the non essential,

  - number: 12
    verse: |

      An heart well-trained in thought.

    verse: |
      He sorroweth here,

  - number: 16
    verse: |
      He rejoiceth here,

      When he seeth hisown deeds clarity.
  - number: 17
    verse: |
      He is tortured here,
      He is tortured hereafter,
      Bothwise is tortured the evil doer;
      He is tortured by thethought: "Twas I who did that wrong!"
      Still more is he tortured,
      When to perdition gone.
  - number: 18
    verse: |
      Here is he glad, hereafter glad,
      The doer of good is bothwise glad;

      Still more is he glad
      When gone to Bliss.
  - number: 19
    verse: |
      Should one recite a portion large,
      Yet not a worker be, but a careless man,
      He is like a cowherd counting others kine,

  - number: 20

      Should one recite a little portion of Doctrine,
      But lead a life according thereunto,
      Renouncing passion, hate, stupidity,
      Truly knowing, with heart set truly free,
      Caring for naught here or hereafter,
      He hath a part in the philosophic life.

      Who knoweth his anterior abodes,
      Who seeth heaven and hell,
      Who birth-destruction hath attained,
      The Sage, accomplished in supernal ken,
      With all accomplishments accomplished:
      Him do I call a Brahmin.
