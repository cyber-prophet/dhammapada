    "368": "The bhikkhu who abides in loving-kindness, who is pleased with the Buddhas Teaching, attains to that state of peace and happiness, the stilling of conditioned things.",

    "389": "One should not strike a br\u00e0hmaua, nor should a br\u00e0hmaua vent (his wrath) on one who has struck him. Shame on him who strikes a br\u00e0hmaua! More shame on him who gives vent (to his wrath).",
    "390": "Unto a br\u00e0hmaua that (non-retaliation) is of no small advantage. When the mind is weaned from things dear, whenever the intent to harm ceases, then and then only doth sorrow subside.",

    "396": "I do not call him a br\u00e0hmaua merely because he is born of a (brahmin) womb or sprung from a (brahmin) mother. He is merely a \"Dear-addresser\", if he be with impediments. He who is free from impediments, free from clinging - him I call a br\u00e0hmaua.",
