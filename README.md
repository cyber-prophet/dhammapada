# Dhammapada

The classic Buddhist sutta, with study materials

[Neatnik](https://neatnik.net) offers [a copy of the Dhammapada](https://neatnik.net/dhammapada/) with a few helpful features:

1. Inline definitions of every Pāli term across all verses
2. Multiple translations
3. Audio version of the Pāli
4. Search across Pāli and English

It’s intended for anyone who would like to read the original text, understand its meaning, and explore different interpretations.

This is a work in progress and will continue to be updated (adding missing audio, additional translations, and other relevant notes).

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or [contact me](https://neatnik.net/adam/) any time. Thanks for your interest in this project!
